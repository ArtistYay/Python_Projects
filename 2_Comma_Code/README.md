This one was stressful...I see why i'm not a software engineer. The main reason why I'm learning python is for scripting, I'm using automate the boring stuff and I am 100% sure 
this was not taught or maybe the material or project instructions wasn't explained good enough for me. Googled, ChatGPT, and Stack Overflowed for help and the answer was 
literally in front of me in section 'Working with Lists'...had some help with the join() method. Coding is pretty difficult lol but I just began so imma push through, until
next time. ‚úåüèΩ

P.S. yes I know it's repeating three times...that's another thing I have to troubleshoot.
